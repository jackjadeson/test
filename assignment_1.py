#-----Statement of Authorship----------------------------------------#
#
#  This is an individual assessment task for QUT's teaching unit
#  IFB104, "Building IT Systems", Semester 2, 2023.  By submitting
#  this code I agree that it represents my own work.  I am aware of
#  the University rule that a student must not act in a manner
#  which constitutes academic dishonesty as stated and explained
#  in QUT's Manual of Policies and Procedures, Section C/5.3
#  "Academic Integrity" and Section E/2.1 "Student Code of Conduct".
#
#  Put your student number here as an integer and your name as a
#  character string:
#
student_number = 11618817
student_name   = 'Jade Jackson'

#  NB: All files submitted for this assessable task will be subjected
#  to automated plagiarism analysis using a tool such as the Measure
#  of Software Similarity (http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)
#  or Copydetect (https://pypi.org/project/copydetect/).

#-----Assessment Task 1 Description----------------------------------#
#
#  This assessment task tests your skills at processing large data
#  sets, creating reusable code and following instructions to display
#  a complex visual image.  The incomplete Python program below is
#  missing a crucial function.  You are required to complete this
#  function so that when the program runs it fills a grid with various
#  symbols, using data stored in a list to determine which symbols to
#  draw and where.  See the online video instructions for
#  full details.
#
#  Note that this assessable assignment is in multiple parts,
#  simulating incremental release of instructions by a paying
#  "client".  This single template file will be used for all parts
#  and you will submit your final solution as this single Python 3
#  file only, whether or not you complete all requirements for the
#  assignment.
#
#  This file relies on other Python modules but all of your code
#  must appear in this file only.  You may not change any of the code
#  in the other modules and you should not submit the other modules
#  with your solution.  The markers will use their own copies of the
#  other modules to test your code, so your solution will not work
#  if it relies on changes made to any other files.
#

#-----Preamble-------------------------------------------------------#
#
# This section imports necessary functions used to execute your code.
# You must NOT change any of the code in this section, and you may
# NOT import any non-standard Python modules that need to be
# downloaded and installed separately.
#

# Import standard Python modules needed to complete this assignment.
# You should not need to use any other modules for your solution.
# In particular, your solution must NOT rely on any non-standard
# Python modules that need to be downloaded and installed separately,
# because the markers will not have access to such modules.

#-----Student's Solution---------------------------------------------#
#
#  Complete the assignment by replacing the dummy function below with
#  your own function and any other functions needed to support it.
#  All of your solution code must appear in this section.  Do NOT put
#  any of your code in any other sections and do NOT change any of
#  the provided code except as allowed by the comments in the next
#  section.
#

# All of your code goes in, or is called from, this function.
# In Task 1B ensure that your code does NOT call functions data_set
# or raw_data because they're already called by the main program
# below.

#-----Main Program to Run Student's Solution-------------------------#
#
# This main program configures the drawing canvas, calls the student's
# function and closes the canvas.  Do NOT change any of this code
# except as allowed by the comments below.  Do NOT put any of
# your solution code in this section.
#

# Configure the drawing canvas
#
# ***** You can add arguments to this function call to modify
# ***** features of the drawing canvas such as the background
# ***** and line colours, etc
create_drawing_canvas()

# Create the data set and pass it to the student's function
#
# ***** While developing your Task 1B code you can call the
# ***** "data_set" function with a fixed seed below for the
# ***** random number generator, but your final solution must
# ***** work with "data_set()" as the function call,
# ***** i.e., for any random data set that can be returned by
# ***** the function when called with no seed
visualise_data(data_set()) # <-- no argument for "data_set" when assessed

# Exit gracefully
#
# ***** Do not change this function call
release_drawing_canvas(student_name)
